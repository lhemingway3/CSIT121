<h1>Final Project</h1>

<h2>Reflection on project</h2>
<p>
The most challenging part of this project for me was styling all my labs the same way.
I had so many different things going on from past labs that I had to go back and edit each one as well as compile all CSS into one style sheet. I also added a new type of navigation using this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp" target="_blank" >navigation bar tutorial</a> from a past lab.
I also had to make sure that navigation worked with the navigation I used with past labs so they were still functional, and I labeled labs more clearly so you can tell what page you're on. I also make the text look a little less overwhelming by not having borders around every heading and paragraph.

</p>
<h2>Observations and lessons from testing</h2>
<p>
I noticed that when I tested on a smaller screen size any lists I had were too compressed to read, so I made all list items flex items.
I also saw that some text was going out of its box on a smaller screen size, so I added more media queries to make that text smaller. I was surprised that the two different kinds of navigation didn't have any issue on different browsers or devices.
</p>
<h2>Reflection on course</h2>
<p>
I usually try to take classes where I'm learning a new coding language in person because I learn better that way,  so I was nervous for this class. But I really feel like I learned a lot and I can understand most of what is going on behind most websites. I feel like the labs were helpful in providing examples of web standards that will be useful in my career. I also saw how some skills I learned from other classes connected to web standards like Javascript.
