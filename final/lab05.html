        <p>This is my first webpage! The HTML practice was a helpful guideline for this since I had a similar format I could reference. The one thing I had to remind myself to do was add the article and footer elements. It is helpful that the list tags are acronyms so I remembered how to do an ordered and unordered list.</p>
        <h3>What I have learned in Lab 2</h3>
            <ul class="skills">
                <li>How to open and close tags</li>
