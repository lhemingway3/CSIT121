        <p>This is my first webpage! The HTML practice was a helpful guideline for this since I had a similar format I could reference. The one thing I had to remind myself to do was add the article and footer elements. It is helpful that the list tags are acronyms so I remembered how to do an ordered and unordered list.</p>
        <h3>What I have learned!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to open and close tags</li>
                <li>Structuring a basic HTML page</li>
                <li>How to add links to my pages</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>I also learned about how to bold and italicize text, as well as looking at tags I haven't used yet. These links helped me:</p>
      
        <ul>

            <li><a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Creating_the_content#creating_your_first_html_document> Element descriptions that were helpful to me.</a></li>
