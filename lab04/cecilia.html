<h1>Cecilia the Swan</h1>
<p>I chose this image because I think this squishmallow is cute and it was one of the few webp files I found. WebP files support millions of colors, use both lossy and lossless compression, and are most useful on websites. I used to be so annoyed when I found WebP files instead of png/jpeg files because they aren't compatible with a lot of software but I have a new appreciation for them since they are better than other files for websites. <a href="https://squishmallowsquad.fandom.com/wiki/Cecilia" target="_blank">Image Source</a> </p>
