    <h1>Duchess the Fawn</h1>
    <p>I chose this image because I found the animation cute. The file type is .gif, which can have a maximum of 256 colors, can be animated, and use lossless compression. I always wondered why the colors in GIFs look so patchy, it makes sense that it is limited. <a href="https://tenor.com/view/squishmallow-squishmallows-deer-fawn-reindeer-gif-24467542" target="_blank">Image Source</a> </p>
