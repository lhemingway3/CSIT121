    What is it?
</h2>
<p>
    Web Security User interface guidelines require information to be presented to users about their online safety. This means presenting information in a way that is understandable to users to increase trust. There are users who have a wide range of experience with technology so these guidelines cater to all of those people. <br><br>
It is essentially communicating the validation going on behind the scenes to user. A good example of this is showing errors in real time while filling out a form to avoid seeing that error only after submitting and having to re-do the whole thing. This way a user can see these errors early on and fix their mistakes. <br><br>
The goal of these guidelines is to make a better user experience and increase user understanding of how a site works. They are also to promote transparency about where a userâ€™s data is going and whether it is secure or not. It is important to have standards to not overwhelm users and effectively communicate these messages.
